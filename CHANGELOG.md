  (Thanks, [carnei-ro](https://github.com/carnei-ro)!)
  [#88](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/88)

- Expose the `prometheus` object for custom metrics
  [#78](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/78)
- Significant performance enhancements; expect manifolds improvements in
  Kong's throughput while using the plugin and reduction in CPU usage while
  memory usage is expected to go up.
  [#79](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/79)

##  [0.7.1] - 2020/01/05

- Fix `full_metric_name` function was not accessible
- Fix linting issues

##  [0.7.0] - 2019/12/04

- **Performance improvements:** Reduced the number of writes (and hence locks)
  to the shared dictionary using lua-resty-counter library.
  (Status API is being shipped with Kong 1.4).
  [#69](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/69)
- Update schema for the plugin for Kong 2.0 compatibility
  [#72](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/72)

##  [0.6.0] - 2019/09/29

  [#66](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/66)

##  [0.5.0] - 2019/09/16

- **Route based metrics:**  All proxy metrics now contain a tag with the name
  or ID of the route.
  [#40](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/issues/40)
- **New metrics releated to Kong's memory usage:**
  New metrics related to Kong's shared dictionaries
  and Lua VMs are now available
  [#62](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/62):
  - per worker Lua VM allocated bytes (`kong_memory_workers_lua_vms_bytes`)
  - shm capacity and bytes allocated (`kong_memory_lua_shared_dict_bytes` and
    `kong_memory_lua_shared_dict_total_bytes`)
- Performance has been improved by avoiding unnecessary timer creation.
  This will lower the impact of the plugin on Kong's overall latency.
  [#60](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/60)
- Tests to ensure gRPC compatibility have been added.
  [#57](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/57)

- Drop the use of `kong.tools.responses` module for
  Kong 1.0 compatibility.
  [#34](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus/pull/34)

##  [0.3.3] - 2018/12/14
